# RPS_Game

Problem Statement
-----------------------------------
We present a novel implementation of the infamous Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)game interaction with the computer. The framework is Tailored to be Computationally lightweight, as well as entertaining. The application is designed in a way that you can decide
go for the best of 5 scores.<br>
The basis of any deep learning model is DATA. Any Machine Learning Enthusiast would agree that in ML the data is far more crucial than the algorithm itself. We need to collect images for the symbol Rock, Paper, Scissor. instead of downloading somebody elseâ€™s data and training on it, we made our dataset.
We have used the concept of Transfer Learning
<br>

Introduction: -
-----------------------------------
Here is a breakdown of our application in steps.<br>
STEP1: Gather Data, for Rock, Paper, and Scissor classes.<br>
STEP2: Visualize the data.<br>
STEP3: Pre-process data and split it.<br>
STEP4: Prepare our model for Transfer Learning.<br>
STEP5: Train Our Model.<br>
STEP6: Check for Accuracy, Loss graph and save the model.<br>
STEP7: Test on Live Webcam Feed.<br>
STEP8: Create the final application.<br>
